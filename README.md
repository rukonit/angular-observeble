# Angular Observable App

In this project I have implemented the concept of Angular RxJs observable functionality. This includes how to create custom observable, pass values, error notification, completion method, operators and end the life cycle through the ngOnDestroy. Also implemented Subject.

## Development server

Navigate to https://gracious-borg-8cf74a.netlify.app. The app will automatically deploy if you change any of the source files committed to the github.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
